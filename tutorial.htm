    <div><p>This game is based on the games in the Warioware series, which are games that contain many short "microgames" that appear in quick succession. Each microgame that appears will give an objective you have to complete. If you fail to complete this within the allotted time, you'll lose a life. As you complete more games, the amount of time given will slowly decrease, pushing your reaction speed further and further! Try to complete as many games as you can!</p></body></div>
    <!-- make it better, also probably add images/gifs for more style and stuff -->
