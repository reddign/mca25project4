    What hasn't been said about me already? I'm a gamer and  an artist going into Software engineering/design as a career (probably), and I 
    have a deadline for making a birthday present which is slowly creeping up on me. Through the fire and the flames
    that has been my last few summers, I was happy to be part of the team for Frogathon! I personally thank Selena for
    the flair this project has and waiting for me every morning, Nate for being the reason most things work, and
