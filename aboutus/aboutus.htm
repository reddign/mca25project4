    Once upon a time, 13.8 billion years ago, the universe underwent cosmic inflation and physics started existing.
    13.799999984 billion years later, a human was created by other humans and named Nathaniel by said other humans.
    What's a human? It's what the humans call themselves. Some humans hate math, which is ironic, because the society
    they find themselves in is just applied social sciences, which is just applied psychology, which is just applied biology,
    which is just applied chemistry, which is just applied physics, which is just applied math. So if humans hate math,
    they actually hate everything. This explains their vindictiveness. Anyways, the human named Nathaniel, who was not the only
    human named Nathaniel, making it not a very useful identification system, decided that the meaning of life was long-term
    happiness. Happiness is a thing humans desire that only makes sense to humans. One thing that brings Nathaniel, who most
    people call Nate due to arbitrary name shortening conventions, happiness is programming. Another thing is meeting other
    humans. As such, Nate signed up for Momentum Coding Academy and attained much happiness, alongside other humans.

    What hasn't been said about me already? I'm a gamer and  an artist going into Software engineering/design as a career (probably), and I 
    have a deadline for making a birthday present which is slowly creeping up on me. Through the fire and the flames
    that has been my last few summers, I was happy to be part of the team for Frogathon! I personally thank Selena for
    the flair this project has and waiting for me every morning, Nate for being the reason most things work, and 
    Micah for always sticking with me and sharing a laugh or two each day. Maybe the important part wasn't the 10 command prompts I learned in class, but rather the
    friends we made along the w--

    Hi! I'm Selena, local introvert. I like the sciences and medicine, and I dream of going into the medical field (which is why it's kind of
    funny that I'm in a coding class!). I'm writing a fantasy novel currently titled The Razing Storms, coming in the next 5-10 business decades.
     I play video games, and I LOVE rabbits. I have a pet rabbit who is running for president in 2028!

        Hi, I'm one of the people who worked on this project. I like spending my free time reading, talking to friends, and playing video games. Some of my favorite games are Oneshot, Celeste, and Persona 3. To be honest, I don't really like programming, which is weird because this <i>is</i> a course entirely based around programming. Despite this, I really enjoyed MCA and working with this team on the project.
